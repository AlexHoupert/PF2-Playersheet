It uses your spell attack modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes @Damage[3d4[mental]] damage. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.</p>\n<p>Any creature that touches the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting <em>umbral graft</em>. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, randomly determine a spell affecting the foe that has a target entry. That spell ceases to affect the target, and you can either cause the spell to affect you or store it in your shadow. If your attempt to Steal was a critical success, you automatically steal the spell if its rank is equal to or lower than umbral graft. If it was a success, you automatically steal it if its rank is lower than umbral graft. If you succeeded, but the spell's rank was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the manipulate trait. The spell lasts for its remaining duration, to a maximum of 1 minute, and any time you keep it stored subtracts from its duration normally. The spell gains the shadow trait.</p>\n<p>You can't steal constant innate spells that are always active on a creature, such as a choral angel's constant tongues, or innate spells that have special restrictions that remove their ability to target other creatures, such as an imp's invisibility. At the GM's discretion, you might not be able to steal innate spells with other unusual modifications to the base spell.</p>\n<p>As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've stolen a spell, you can't attempt to Steal more spells, nor can you choose not to take a spell if you succeed at your Thievery check. When you cast umbral graft, any spells you stole with a previous umbral graft end even if their duration hasn't elapsed. If you're affected by both umbral graft and umbral extraction, you make the choice whether to steal a spell slot, an active spell, or an item each time you Steal.</p>",

To be alive is to define your knowledge as being limited, but with the corpse communion ritual, you can, if only for a short time and through a narrow aperture, tap into the greater lore of the dead and make use of it for your own designs.</p>\n<p>When you perform this grisly ritual, you consume a portion of a dead body, taking the decayed flesh and old bones into your system while also taking into your mind the memories etched into those mortal remains. The corpse from which you harvest your necromantic meal cannot have been dead for longer than 1 month, and it need not even be entirely intact, but enough should be present to form what would be regarded as a satisfying meal. If, in life, the corpse was the same ancestry as your own, then you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the primary check to cast corpse communion. Note that when you perform corpse communion, the remains you consume are largely a symbolic bridge between this material world and the world of the dead. The ritual allows you to tap into the vast amount of knowledge and secrets held by the dead as a whole, not simply knowledge that may have once been held by the creature you feed upon.</p>\n<p>When you perform this ritual, select a single Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill whose secrets you wish to delve into, but in which you possess no greater proficiency in than trained.</p>\n<p>The ritual itself does not protect you from potential infection from eating decayed flesh, and at the GM's discretion, performing this ritual could expose you to a disease, curse, or other affliction.</p>\n<p>If you perform corpse communion again while already under its effects, the effects of any previous success or critical success are replaced by the results of the new ritual casting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You learn a significant piece of lore, a forgotten secret, or some other tantalizing nugget of knowledge that is of immediate use to you, connected to the skill you chose.

To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two. A demiplane created with this ritual exists on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a forest clearing, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else imaginable. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.</p>\n<p>Demiplanes have environmental conditions appropriate for the Universe, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.</p>\n<p>When you first cast <em>create demiplane</em>, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Interplanar Teleport] or similar abilities are necessary to access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane, you create a planar key to the demiplane that serves as an <em>interplanar teleport</em> locus for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the form of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.</p>\n<p>If you have the original planar key to an existing demiplane and are also on that demiplane, you can cast this ritual again. Each time, you can either expand the demiplane's size or add one special trait or feature described below.</p><ul><li><strong>Bounteous</strong> The demiplane has a functional ecosystem with plants and animals appropriate to the environment. This ecosystem doesn't require any additional effort on your part to maintain.</li><li><strong>Elemental</strong> The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood planar essence trait.</li><li><strong>Gravity</strong> The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.</li><li><strong>Key</strong> You create an additional planar key that can be used to access the demiplane with <em>interplanar teleport</em> and improve it with <em>create demiplane</em>.</li><li><strong>Portal</strong> You create a permanent gateway between the demiplane and a single other location. You must spend the ritual's casting time constructing the gateway on the external side, which typically resembles an arch or doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can be secured as you would any door.</li><li><strong>Scope</strong> The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite, though still with the same size.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You create a new demiplane whose area consists of 10 contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side. The ceiling is 40 feet high.

    "description": "<p>You perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Freedom]. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p><ul><li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell rank and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li><li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li><li><strong>Slumber</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. This is a sleep effect. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber.</li><li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Dispel Magic] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Haste] spell.</li><li><strong>Object (9th or 10th rank)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a bottle, gem, jar, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it.</li><li><p><strong>Oubliette (10th rank only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent most magic from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Wish] ritual, can reveal the location of the <em>imprisonment</em>, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank <em>freedom</em> ritual can do so.</p></li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You imprison the target.

Some cultures—such as the many denizens of the Plane of Air and star-gazing iruxis—develop complex symbology to communicate clearly using <em>sky signs</em>.</p>\n<p>The message appears in the sky above you and can be seen to the horizon. To be conveyed in this way, the message must be very simple—typically something that can be expressed in 5 words or fewer. The symbols look the same to anyone who sees them. If you wish to conceal a message, you need to choose symbols that will make sense to your chosen audience but not to any other onlookers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You display your chosen signs, and the message is clear to anyone who sees it.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You display a somewhat muddled version of your message. The signs aren't entirely clear and require interpretation from those who view them—and many interpret them incorrectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You're unable to show your message.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The spirits of air find your message audacious and offensive. As punishment, they emblazon the opposite of your intended message across the sky, and the message is clear to anyone who sees it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The scope of your message is truly staggering and can be seen across the entire planet.</p>",

You take the role of the director, while the secondary casters are either actors (Performance) or significant backstage figures, such as set or costume designers (Crafting). The casting time of the ritual includes both preparations and rehearsals of various sorts and the actual performance, which must be at least an hour long.</p>\n<p>The performance presents current events and offers a particular vision on how they resolve, often in metaphorical or allegorical format (proposing the overthrow of a tyrant by referring to a different, legendary tyrant who was overthrown, or suggesting that a murderous secret might be uncovered by presenting an allegory of truth defeating murder). This performance must be presented to an audience of at least a hundred people, a majority of whom must both be connected, at least peripherally, to the events in question (the people of the tyrant's city, or the residents of the village where the murder occurred) and who must understand what the metaphor or allegory actually refers to. For the magic to spark, the performance must declare its purpose loudly and clearly to the parties most concerned. If a major antagonist featured in the performance is in the audience and the ritual is a success, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Something sublime sparks between performance and audience, and destiny conspires to push events in the right direction.

    "description": "<p>You weave the fabric of reality itself to grant the target's greatest desire. The target declares their wish in a loud voice at the start of the ritual and again at the end. The target's wish can be anything, ranging from simpler wishes such as vast riches or the casting of a certain spell or ritual, to greater wishes like the destruction of an entire kingdom or ascension to divinity. The GM might decide a wish draws the attention of deities or other powerful creatures, leading to interference with the ritual or attempts to undo the wish. The power of the ritual alters reality to such a degree that even deities can't outright undo the wish, but they can react to the wish by sending servitors to take away the newly acquired riches, for example.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The wish is granted without complication or drawbacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The wish is granted, but with unintended consequences or side effects, such as taking riches from a well-known criminal, stirring a damaged kingdom to war, or angering rival gods.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The wish fails and has no result. The GM can instead have the wish be partially granted, but to such a lesser degree that the target will be eternally unsatisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The wish is corrupted, resulting in a cruel fulfillment. The GM determines the full results, but the outcome is generally ironic in some nature, such as becoming trapped in an underground vault full of riches, being transported to the kingdom as it's destroyed, or achieving divinity within an inaccessible demiplane.</p>",
